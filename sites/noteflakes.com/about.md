My name is Sharon Rosner, and Noteflakes is my personal website. I am an independent software developer based in France. I specialize in internet-enabled industrial control systems and integration of internet services. When not in front of a computer screen I like gardening, building stuff, making food and listening to music.

I am the author of multiple [open-source libraries and applications](https://github.com/ciconia), mostly around the Ruby programming language, but I've also dabbled in C, C++, Go, Lua, PHP and Scheme. In my open source work I've been building a set of tools called collectively [Digital Fabric](https://github.com/digital-fabric), aimed at liberating developers and contributing to a more democratic, decentralized web.

This website was made and is run using my own tools:

- [Impression](https://github.com/digital-fabric/impression) - a (WIP) framework for creating web apps
- [Tipi](https://github.com/digital-fabric/tipi) - a modern web server for Ruby
- [Polyphony](https://github.com/digital-fabric/polyphony) - a platform for creating highly-concurrent Ruby apps
