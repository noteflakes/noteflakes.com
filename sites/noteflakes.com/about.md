## About Noteflakes

My name is Sharon Rosner, and Noteflakes is my independent software consulting
company. I am an independent software developer based in France. My main fields
of expertise:

- Internet-enabled process-control systems.
- Integration of internet services for industrial and B2B apps.
- Storage, retrieval and analysis of time series data (for industrial and B2B
  applications).

I build tailor-made solutions for my clients, based on my many years of
experience in integrating process-control systems with internet platforms in a
secure and robust manner. Please feel free to contact me, I'd love to hear about
your project.

I have created a web platform for operating and monitoring infrastructure
facilities for [RealiteQ](https://realiteq.com/), providing secure, web enabled
SCADA and telemetry services for thousands of facilities in dozens of countries
around the world.

## Open-Source Software

I am the author of multiple [open-source libraries and
applications](https://github.com/noteflakes), mostly around the Ruby programming
language, but I also dabble in C, C++, Go, Lua, PHP and Scheme. I am the
original author of the popular [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel)
database toolkit for Ruby.

If you like my open-source work, please consider [sponsoring
me](https://github.com/sponsors/noteflakes).

When not in front of a computer screen I garden, build stuff, make food and hang
out with family and friends.
