## About Noteflakes

My name is Sharon Rosner, and Noteflakes is my independent software consulting
company. I am an independent software developer based in France. My main fields
of expertise:

- Internet-enabled process-control systems.
- Integration of internet services for industrial and B2B apps.
- Storage, retrieval and analysis of time series data (for industrial and B2B
  applications).

I am the author of multiple [open-source libraries and
applications](https://github.com/noteflakes), mostly around the Ruby programming
language, but I also dabble in C, C++, Go, Lua, PHP and Scheme. In my open
source work I've been building a set of tools called collectively [Digital
Fabric](https://github.com/digital-fabric), aimed at liberating developers and
contributing to a more democratic, decentralized web.

I build tailor-made solutions for my clients, based on my many years of
experience in integrating process-control systems with internet platforms in a
secure and robust manner. Please feel free to contact me, I'd love to hear about
your project.

When not in front of a computer screen I garden, build stuff, make food and hang
out with family and friends.
