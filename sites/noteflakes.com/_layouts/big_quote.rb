  There's a place for us,
  Somewhere a place for us.
  Peace and quiet and open air
  Wait for us somewhere.

  There's a time for us,
  Someday a time for us.
  Time together with time to spare,
  Time to learn, time to care.

  Someday, somewhere
  We'll find a new way of living,
  We'll find a way of forgiving,
  Somewhere.
