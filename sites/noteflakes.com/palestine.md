## On Palestine

We cannot look away from the suffering of people in Palestine and in Israel. It
is our moral duty as daughters and sons of the earth to strive for peace and
justice for all.

The Israeli military campaign against the people of Gaza and the West Bank is a
grave moral failure, and will one day be universally recognized for what it is:
a crime against humanity.

It is a crime against humanity to [starve helpless people](https://www.972mag.com/gaza-humanitarian-aid-israeli-impunity/).

It is a crime against humanity to [shoot at innocent people desparate for scraps
of food](https://www.972mag.com/hunger-games-israel-gaza-food-aid/).

It is a crime against humanity to [drive people off their
land](https://www.972mag.com/masafer-yatta-father-interview/) because they do
not belong to "the chosen people".

It is a crime against humanity to [imprison and torture men, women and
children](https://www.972mag.com/israel-prisons-scabies/) without trial or any
due process.

It is a crime against humanity to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, wells and
[olive
orchards](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/23/israeli-military-uproots-thousands-of-palestinian-olive-trees-in-west-bank).

Those crimes are driven by an extremist ideology that will not refrain from any
means in pursuing its political objective - a land cleansed of its native
population, with a few besieged enclaves for those who remain.

In its delusional, immoral project of ethnic cleansing and destruction of any
non-Jewish political and cultural identity in Israel/Palestine, the Zionist
regime is committing crimes of war and crimes against humanity.

This **war against humanity** not only causes suffering and destruction to
Palestinians, it also corrupts and destroys the souls of Israelians, who
willingly and blindly obey the instructions of the regime. How can a
soldier who shot an innocent child in the head come back home and with the
same hand caress his own child's head?

Just like in [The Picture of Dorian
Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray), Israel sees
itself as a beacon of liberalism, of morality and of justice ("a villa in the
jungle", "a light unto the nations"), while hiding away its real, disfigured
portrait in the attic [so no one will
see](https://www.972mag.com/israel-hamas-journalists-smear-gaza/).

Zionism is not only destroying the Palestinian people, it is also destroying
Judaism itself. A non-political religion, the religion of people who lived in
the margins of society, who had no political power, who often fell victims to
persecution, discrimination and violence, the religion of the descendants of
slaves, has become a vehicle for a racist colonialist project, and has been
consumed by it.

Though I no longer live there, I still have family in Israel and I still follow
the news from there. In my visits over the years, I have seen my country of
birth change rapidly: nature subjugated and imprisoned under concrete, hills
disfigured, villages erased, walls and guard towers erected, and the Israeli
people - the descendants of slaves and prisoners - become a "master race",
oblivious to the moral cost of maintaining an apartheid state, indifferent to
the suffering of millions at the hands of "the most moral army in the world",
believing in military might as the answer to any political problem.

Indeed, what does remain of Judaism, what does remain of Israel, except for the
racism and the war and the military and the endless violence?

endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a
spirit of brotherhood. - [Universal Declaration of Human
Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)

The current moral crisis engulfing humanity - not just in Palestine/Israel -
requires us to step up and give voice to our moral convictions: stop the war,
stop the bloodshed, stop the starvation, stop the occupation, stop the madness!
