# Noteflakes

Noteflakes is the personal website of Sharon Rosner. I am an independent software developer based in France. I specialize in internet-enabled industrial control systems and integration of internet services. I am the author of multiple [open-source libraries and applications](https://github.com/ciconia). When not in front of a computer screen I like gardening, building stuff, making food and listening to music.

This website was made and is run using my own set of tools:

- [Impression](https://github.com/digital-fabric/impression) - a (WIP) framework for creating web apps
- [Tipi](https://github.com/digital-fabric/tipi) - a modern web server for Ruby
- [Polyphony](https://github.com/digital-fabric/polyphony) - a platform for creating highly-concurrent Ruby apps

Here's a link to the [source code](https://github.com/ciconia/noteflakes.com).
